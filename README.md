# UINavigationController-SLTransitioning
A UINavigationController category which contains multiple transitioning styles for use. Inspired by `navigationItem`, I make navigation transitioning as simple as that. In this category, there are multiple styles for transitioning, including System (Default), Fade, Divide, Resign Top, Resign Left, Filp Over, Image and Cover Vertical (Top or Bottom). What makes it more meaningful is that you can easily add your custom beautiful transitioing style into it. But, there are still some shortages, like the lack of interactive pop geatures. Maybe I will think of a good idea to solve it, or you can be the solver.

So, Let's enjoy it.
